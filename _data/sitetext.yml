      - title: "Functional Genomics of Cellular Differentiation"
        desc: "We use myogenesis and myeloid cell differentiation as models of differentiation in a dish for functional genomics. We use assays such RNA-seq, microRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq to understand how gene expression and chromatin state change in time courses of differentiation."

        desc: "We are building models of gene regulatory networks using either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq in human, rodents, and other vertebrates."

      #     **Research Interests:**
      #     \nI have three main projects. The first is my main thesis project investigating a time-series of embryonic stem cell differentiation to neuronal and endodermal lineages via RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in multiple mammalian species. The transcriptional and chromatin information gathered from these time courses are used to build and compare gene regulatory networks for each lineage and species. The second and third projects are related collaboration projects in collaboration with the Baram lab at UC Irvine. Both projects investigate early life stress (ELS) and how early life experiences can affect gene expression and contribute to mental illness in adulthood. The first of these investigates single cell transcriptomics of Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing neurons of the mouse hypothalamus after a model of ELS. Cells from the hypothalamus are separated via FACS and the transcriptome is analyzed via single cell RNA-seq. The second related project investigates methylation heterogeneity in human babies via buccal swabs during the first year of life to investigate a range of ELS in humans.
